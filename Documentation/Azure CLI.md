The **Azure CLI** is a cross-platform, command-line tool designed to help developers and administrators manage Azure resources using simple, scriptable commands. It enables automation of tasks such as creating and modifying resource groups, deploying virtual machines, managing storage, configuring networking, and interacting with many Azure services. Azure CLI works on Windows, macOS, and Linux, integrates well with CI/CD pipelines, and provides a consistent interface for managing cloud infrastructure programmatically or interactively.
