A **Dev Container** is a reproducible, isolated development environment defined by configuration files (such as a `devcontainer.json`) that specify tools, runtimes, extensions, and settings needed for a project. Using containers ensures every developer—and every CI system—works in an identical environment, eliminating “works on my machine” issues. Dev Containers are commonly used with VS Code or GitHub Codespaces, allowing projects to spin up consistent, preconfigured environments instantly.
