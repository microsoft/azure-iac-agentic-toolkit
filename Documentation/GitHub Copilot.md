**GitHub Copilot** is an AI-powered coding assistant that helps developers write code faster and with less friction by suggesting entire lines, functions, tests, and documentation directly within the editor. Trained on a broad range of public code and natural language, it provides context-aware completions, explains code, transforms code between languages, and assists with common developer workflows. Copilot integrates with popular IDEs like VS Code, JetBrains, and Neovim, and supports tasks ranging from prototyping to production-level development.
